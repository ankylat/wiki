# Anky Genesis Smart Contract

Welcome. I created this place to explain to you what this is about.

I thought about using thirdweb to implement the functionalities of the smart contracts of Anky, but I decided not to do it.

Instead, I taught myself how to write solidity so that we could have a custom smart contract.

I needed the most important feature of this collection: You can only have one Anky in your wallet.

This place is where I will explain to you why I did what I did.

I want Anky to be the place where you can come and learn how to do this thing.

I want to learn how to be your teacher.

This is how I do that.

Welcome.
