# Specs

As I pose myself the challenge of writing this smart contract, I see the following items as necessary:

- The collections consists of 8888 characters.
- Each character has its image pinned to IPFS using pinata.
- Each character has its metadata pinned to IPFS with the link to the image pinned inside.
- The contract needs to send the first 30 ETH that enter to the wallet of Morten, so that I can buy the BAYC NFT. That exchange is built out of pure trust. The next X ETH will be spent on the 8 otherdeeds that will be the place on which this world will unfold.
- Hopefully bring in gas optimizations.
- Checks was minted at 8 usd without having to pay for gas. Can I do that?
- The contract will be called from the react frontend.
- The NFTs need to be minted randomly.
- The first part of the smart contract will be the story of the Ankyverse.
- Minting can only be done from the official website.
