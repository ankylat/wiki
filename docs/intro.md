# Anky

This place is alive. With you. As you.

Anky is an invitation. To find yourself. To connect with yourself. Anky is a vehicle for the exploration into what happens when you believe in yourself.

In the power of your actions.

In the strength that you have inside.

The mission of Anky is to develop practical tools for catalyzing your connection with yourself.

Because from there comes peace.

From there comes joy.

The joy of knowing that you are already complete.

The joy of experiencing that you are already everything that you came here to be.

It is just that it is so easy to forget.

Anky is an exploration into what happens when you remember.

It is a community without the community.

A community of people that do the work.

And support each other in doing it.

There are so many communities out there that are for connecting with others.

This one is for connecting with yourself.

Welcome to the Ankyverse.

It is an honor to have you here.
