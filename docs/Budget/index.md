# Budget

There are 8888 Anky Genesis. Each of them costs 0.01618. If you do the math, that accounts to 143.80784 eth.

I will spend the next 3 sojourns learning about the internet, learning about blockchain, learning about programming, learning about meditation, learning about how to play drums, learning how to create content, learning how to tell stories, learning anything that I need to learn in order to make this project successful. In the open. And the money that will enter the smart contract will help me do that, because it will enable to devote 100% of my energy to this. And to my family. Without having to care about money. Just caring about creating something awesome. Just caring about being myself. Without that noise on the background that tells me I'm not enough.

Anyway, so this is how I will spend the money during this first 96 + 21 + 96 + 21 + 96 days. If I don't make it after that, I'm gonna make sure you will never be able to say:

At least he tried.

YUGA BAG - (@mortpoker)[https://www.twitter.com/mortpoker] will be the person that gets all this bag together and sell it to us.

All prices are estimates and depend on FP, but you get the point.

- 3 \* 8 ETH -> Otherdeeds for building the Ankyverse on the otherside.

- 12 \* 3 ETH -> Salary of JP for 12 months.
- 1 \* 4 ETH -> Craftmanship of the Legendary Masks IRL.
- 3 \* 3 ETH -> For the trip to go and get the legendary masks.
- 10 ETH -> Credits and payments for web services.
- 8 ETH -> Tinybox
- 8 ETH -> Buy NFTs from small projects that need love.
- 3 \* 3 ETH -> For vacations of jp and family in between sojourns.
- 5 ETH -> Education and therapy for jp

The sum of all of this is 144 Eth. What I offer in exchange of that is 100 minutes of my absolute focus of creative energy building the Ankyverse, for each one of the 96 day sojourns.
