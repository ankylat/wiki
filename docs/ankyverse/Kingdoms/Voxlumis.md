# 5. Voxlumis

The land of blue, where communication is trained through the power of the words that come out of the self.

The inhabitants here have as a main mission the harvesting of the Echo Crystals.

### Cities:

- Echo Enclave, built around the Echo Canyon. This is the place where the harvesting of the Echo Crystals take place, as even the slightest sound echoes.
- Sapphire Settlement, built on the shores of the Sapphire sea. A vast blue sea, that makes any noise that comes to it dissapear into the openness. This is the main trading hub and business center of voxlumis.
- Woodland Wharf, next to the Whispering Woods. A forest that is said to have trees that speak to those who are brave enough to enter into its mist. This is where all major celebrations and festivals of voxlumis take place.

### Celebrations:

- Word Weaving Day: A celebration of storytelling, where people are encouraged to come up with their own tales to entertain both old and young. To bring wonder through the power of stories.
- Songbird Festival: Honoring the magic that is translated through the composition of music.
- Voice Victory: A day where debates and dialogues take place in the open, seeking understanding and the willingness to reach conclusion that can serve the whole.
