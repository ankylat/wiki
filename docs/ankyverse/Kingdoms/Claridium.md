# 7. Claridium

The land of violet, of the enlightened beings. Where all of those that have realized their true nature give a warm welcome to businessman and homeless alike. We are all welcome.

The inhabitants here have as a main mission the harvesting of the Enlightenment Crystals.

### Cities:

- Crystal City, next to the Crystal Cliffs, majestic structures of atomic elements combined with each other on an ordered way that feels like magic. This is where the Enlightenment Crytals are harvested.
- Echo Empire, where the mystical caves Ethereal Echoes bring a spiritual vibration to Claridium that resonates with the heart of the Ankyverse. This is the city where Ankyeans live inside their houses made out of crystals.
- Ascent Arrival, the main port city that host all major celebrations and festivals of Claridium. There is a towering mountain next to this place, which is said to have the powers of showing those who dare to climb it the truth of their existence.

### Celebrations:

- The Spirit's Symposium: A gathering for spiritual discourses, where the actual weirdness of the spiritual path is spoken of with mighty openness.
- The Enlightenment Eve: A night where Claridiumses invite folks from all around (and within) the Ankyverse to delve into the mysteries of consciousness through the power of introspection.
