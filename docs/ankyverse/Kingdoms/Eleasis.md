# 4. Eleasis

The land of green: compassion. Of the power of giving and receiving, and how this is an expression of the balance of life.

The inhabitants here have as a main mission the harvesting of the Healing Herbs.

### Cities:

- Pond Pavilion, home of the Healing Pond. This is a small pond with healing properties, where the key resource of Eleasis grows: The Healing Herbs.
- Grove Galleria, home of the Emerald Grove. Emerald green grass gives birth to this beautiful landmark, around which the main trading hub and business center is built.
- Leaf Spot, home of the Love Leaf Locus. It has always been a mystery why all of the leaves that surround this place are heart-shaped, but it is the perfect place to host all the major festivals and celebrations of Eleasis.

### Celebrations:

- Love's Bloom, a festival celebrating love.
- Renewal Day, a day to renew vows and relationships.
