# 3. Chryseos

The land of yellow: personal strength, willpower and transformation.

The inhabitants here have as a main mission the harvesting of the Lustrous Minerals.

### Cities:

- Lustrous Landing, home of the Labyrinth of the same name. It is a maze made out of shiny yellow minerals. Inside this maze is where the Lustrous Minerals are harvested, which is the key resource of Chryseos.
- Sandstone Square, home of the Shimmering Sands. An open desert with golden sands. This is the main trading hub and business center of Chryseos.
- Savanna Soiree, home of the Sunflower Savannas. Endless plains covered of sunflowers. It is said that once every sojourn these blossom and it is one of the most fascinating events of the Ankyverse to watch. This is the main port city, which hosts all of the major celebrations and festivals of Chryseos.

### Celebrations:

- Transformation Festival: Celebrating personal growth and change.
- Golden Gala: A grand gathering and feast, where life is celebrated with the taste of food cooked with the heart.
