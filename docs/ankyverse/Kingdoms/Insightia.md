# 6. Insightia

The indigo land, associated with the intuitive power of the third eye. For that which is not seen. To the force that propels you to chase your dreams. Consciusness applied to your actions.

The inhabitants here have as a main mission the harvesting of the dream crystals.

### Cities:

- Dreamweaver's Dwelling: Home of the Dreamweaver's Den, a mystic cave filled with ancient prophecies. It is said that those who are able to move past the riddles that take you there, enter into a cosmic conversation with those being that are invisble to plain sight.
- Maze Metropolis: A city that was built around the Mind's Maze, a labytinth that challenges each aspect of your mind, bringing it upside down. This ended up being the main trading hub and business center of Insightia, due to the propelling aspects that the maze has in relationship to how it enables visitors to see what was hidden at plain sight before.
- Veil Venue, which is located alongside the Visionary Veil. A misty valley known for inducing prophetic visions. Those that walk the depths of it end up being transported to a world where the ether communicates with you in ways that the mind can't conceive, so it has to stay out of the equation. The main port city of this kingdom, hosts all the major celebrations and festivals of Insightia.

### Celebrations:

- Moon Meditation Night. A full night dedicated to absorb the senses in meditation, down the light of the brightests lights coming from the lamps that enable each one of the participants of the Ankyverse to see each other.
- Prophecy Day: A day of prophetic readings and interpretations, where those that are connected more deeply with the ethers give signals to the rest of the world about where it is heading, and how to best act upon that realization.
