# 8. Insightia

The mysterious land filled with mushrooms, which give it the wisdom of the mycelium that is beyond the surface.

### Cities:

- Muse's metropolis is a network of streets and mushrooms that serve as the ground on which the magical Inspiration Mushrooms come, which are the key resource of Poiesis. Next to this city you can experience The Muse's Cap, a mushroom that is spoken of as the speaker of the muses.
- Creation City: This is the main trading hub of poiesis, with an agora on which artists and creators from all around the Ankyverse gather to share their joy of for the creative act. This is the home of The Creation Cradle, a valley known for its inspiring views.
- The Inspiration Inlet is a coastal area that inspires creativity, and which gave birth to Inlet Island, main port city in Poiesis, where all major celebrations and festivals of Poiesis take place.

### Celebrations:

- Imagination Illumination is a festival of light and creativity where each participant is asked to create a lantern out of LED lights, so that they can share their creativity with the world.
- The White Mas is a festival where everyone paints and gets painted. A celebration to color. A celebration to life.
