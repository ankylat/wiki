# Kingdoms

Inside the Ankyverse there are 8 kingdoms, each one of them a metaphorical representation of the energy of the chakras. The energy that runs through your veins, through your whole body, and that just wants to be free.

But it gets stuck in old patterns of behavior.

Each one of these worlds exist to help you with those blocks.

So that you can fully comprehend them. So that you can fully experience them. So that you can integrate them.

So that you can evolve.

So that you can be more of you.
